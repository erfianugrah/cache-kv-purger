# Areas for Improvement in cache-kv-purger

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Parallel Batch Deletion**
   - Current implementation processes batches sequentially
   - Enhancement: Add concurrent batch deletion similar to WriteMultipleValuesConcurrently in batch.go
   - Impact: Could significantly improve throughput for large deletions (>1000 keys)

2. **Adaptive Concurrency**
   - Current implementation uses fixed concurrency values
   - Enhancement: Implement adaptive concurrency based on API response times
   - Impact: Better utilization of available API capacity while avoiding rate limits

3. **Memory Optimization**
   - Large operations can consume significant memory when fetching all keys upfront
   - Enhancement: Implement "cursor streaming" approach for extremely large namespaces
   - Impact: Reduced memory footprint for operations on namespaces with millions of keys

## Robustness Improvements

1. **Enhanced Error Recovery**
   - Current fallback logic is binary (try bulk, fall back to individual)
   - Enhancement: Implement graduated fallback with partial batch recovery
   - Impact: More resilient operations that can continue despite partial failures

2. **Smarter Rate Limit Handling**
   - Current implementation has minimal backoff
   - Enhancement: Add exponential backoff with jitter for rate limit responses
   - Impact: Fewer failed operations due to rate limiting

3. **Resumable Operations**
   - Current operations must restart completely if interrupted
   - Enhancement: Add checkpointing and resume capability
   - Impact: Long-running operations can be paused and resumed

## User Experience Enhancements

1. **Progress Visualization**
   - Current progress reporting is text-only
   - Enhancement: Add simple ASCII progress bars with ETA
   - Impact: Better visibility into long-running operations

2. **Default Configuration File**
   - Currently requires manual setup
   - Enhancement: Auto-generate sample config on first run
   - Impact: Easier onboarding for new users

3. **Interactive Mode**
   - Current interface is purely command-line
   - Enhancement: Add optional interactive prompts for destructive operations
   - Impact: Safer operations with confirmation workflows

## Code Architecture Improvements

1. **Complete Command Builder Migration**
   - Partially implemented builder pattern
   - Enhancement: Finish migrating all commands to the builder pattern
   - Impact: More consistent code, easier maintenance

2. **Client Interface Abstraction**
   - API client is tightly coupled to Cloudflare
   - Enhancement: Abstract client interface for better testing and potential multi-provider support
   - Impact: Improved testability and potential for expanded functionality

3. **Context Support**
   - Current operations lack context.Context integration
   - Enhancement: Add context support for cancellation and timeouts
   - Impact: Better control over long-running operations

## Documentation Enhancements

1. **API Reference Documentation**
   - Current docs focus on CLI usage
   - Enhancement: Add comprehensive API reference for library usage
   - Impact: Better support for programmatic usage

2. **Performance Guidelines**
   - Current docs lack performance best practices
   - Enhancement: Add section on optimal patterns for large operations
   - Impact: Users can better optimize their usage patterns

3. **Command Tree Visualization**
   - Command hierarchy can be complex
   - Enhancement: Add visual command tree in documentation
   - Impact: Easier discovery of available functionality
