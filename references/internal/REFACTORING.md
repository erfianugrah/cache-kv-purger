   - [x] Enhance BatchProcessor for different item types if needed

4. **Zone Resolution Consolidation**
   - [x] Remove redundant implementations
   - [x] Centralize all zone handling in zones package

5. **API Response Parsing**
   - [x] Create generic parsing utilities
   - [x] Update service files to use the parsing utilities

6. **Remove Deprecated Utility Functions**
   - [x] Identify deprecated functions
   - [x] Update callers to use centralized implementation
   - [x] Remove deprecated files

7. **Standardize Dry Run and Confirmation Logic**
   - [x] Create consistent helpers for dry runs
   - [x] Standardize confirmation prompts

8. **Consistent Output Formatting**
   - [x] Ensure all commands use the common output formatters

## Implementation Details

### 1. File Reading Consolidation (Completed)
- Created `internal/common/fileutils.go` with:
  - Generic `ReadItemsFromFile` function to handle multiple file formats (CSV, JSON, plain text)
  - Options struct for customizing reading behavior
  - Auto-detection of file types based on extension
- Updated `tags_cmd.go` as an example of using the new utility

### 2. API Response Parsing (Completed)
- Created `internal/api/parser.go` with:
  - `ParseAPIResponse` function for standard API responses
  - `ParsePaginatedResponse` function for paginated responses
  - Added error formatting utility
- Updated zone operations in `internal/zones/zones.go` to use the parser

### 3. Verbosity Standardization (Completed)
- Created `internal/common/verbosity.go` with:
  - `Verbosity` struct for consistent handling of output levels
  - Methods for different output levels (normal, verbose, debug)
  - Progress tracking helpers
- Enhanced `internal/cmdutil/middleware.go` with new middleware functions:
  - `WithVerbosity`
  - `WithClientAndVerbosity`
  - `WithConfigClientAndVerbosity`
- Added demo command (`verbosity_demo_cmd.go`) showcasing the new verbosity handling

### 4. Zone Resolution Consolidation (Completed)
- Enhanced `internal/zones/zones.go` with more comprehensive zone handling:
  - Added `ProcessMultiZoneItems` to standardize multi-zone operations
  - Created `wrapper.go` with backward compatibility functions
  - Implemented a generic handler pattern for zone operations
- Updated `internal/common/zone.go` to delegate to the zones package
- Created clear deprecation notices on older implementations

### 5. Batch Processing Standardization (Completed)
- Created a generic version of `BatchProcessor` using Go generics in `internal/common/batchprocessor.go`:
  - New `BatchProcessor[T, R]` can process any input and output types
  - Added full type safety while maintaining the same API
  - Maintained backward compatibility with original `BatchProcessor`
- Created a demo command (`batch_demo_cmd.go`) showing:
  - Original string-only batch processor usage
  - Generic batch processor with strings
  - Generic batch processor with custom structs
- Made `SplitIntoBatches` generic as well to work with any data type

### 6. Removing Deprecated Utility Functions (Completed)
- Identified deprecated utility functions in the codebase:
  - `splitIntoBatches` and `removeDuplicates` in utils.go
  - `getZoneInfo` in zone_utils.go
- Updated all command files to use the centralized implementations:
  - Modified hosts_cmd.go, prefixes_cmd.go, and files_cmd.go to use common.RemoveDuplicates
  - Updated files to use common.SplitIntoBatches
  - Changed references to getZoneInfo to use zones.GetZoneDetails
- Removed deprecated utility files:
  - Deleted cmd/cache-kv-purger/utils.go
  - Deleted cmd/cache-kv-purger/zone_utils.go

### 7. Standardizing Dry Run and Confirmation Logic (Completed)
- Created a comprehensive dry run handling system in `internal/common/dryrun.go`:
  - Added `DryRunOptions` for configuring dry run behavior
  - Implemented `HandleDryRun` and `HandleDryRunWithSample` for different display modes
  - Created standardized item display functions for batched operations
- Added a consistent confirmation system:
  - Implemented `ConfirmBatchOperation` for prompting with context
  - Standardized confirmation messages across operations
  - Added support for skipping confirmation with `--force`
- Updated the tags command to use the new standardized helpers
  - Added a force flag for skipping confirmations
  - Implemented both normal and batch operation confirmations
  - Improved dry run output with consistent formatting

### 8. Consistent Output Formatting (Completed)
- Created an enhanced output formatter in `internal/common/formatter.go`:
  - Implemented `OutputFormatter` with flexible configuration options
  - Added support for different output formats (text, JSON, table)
  - Created specialized formatters for headers, tables, lists, and more
  - Added progress reporting with live updates
  - Integrated with the verbosity system for consistent detail levels
- Added a demo command (`format_demo_cmd.go`) showcasing:
  - Different output formats (text, JSON)
  - Table formatting
  - Key-value pairs
  - Progress reporting
  - List formatting
- Updated the prefixes command to use the new formatter

## Next Steps

All planned refactorings have been completed! The code is now better organized, more maintainable, and follows better software engineering practices.
